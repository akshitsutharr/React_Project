A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an advanced type of artificial intelligence trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. It can perform a wide range of tasks such as answering questions, writing essays, translating languages, generating code, and more. LLMs like ChatGPT learn patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning from their training data, allowing them to predict and produce coherent and contextually relevant text. They are called "large" because they have billions (or even trillions) of parameters — the internal weights that guide their understanding and responses.

💡 Deep Explanation (Beginner Friendly)
🔸 How 2D arrays are stored in memory:
A 2D array like int arr[3][4] is stored in row-major order.

That means: all the elements of row 0 are stored first, then row 1, and so on — as a continuous 1D block in memory.

So, arr[1][2] is located after 1 complete row (4 columns) and 2 elements into the second row.

🔸 What happens when passing to a function?
Let's say you define a function:

cpp
Copy
Edit
void printArray(int arr[][4], int rows);

The Gemini model, developed by Google DeepMind, is based on a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture — similar to GPT (like ChatGPT) — but with a major difference:

✅ In One Simple Paragraph:
The Gemini model is based on a multimodal architecture, meaning it is designed to handle text, images, audio, video, and code together. It is part of Google’s next-generation AI family and combines the power of large-scale transformer models (like GPT) with advanced reasoning and perception capabilities. Gemini is built upon Google's prior models like PaLM 2, enhanced with innovations from AlphaGo (reinforcement learning and planning). It can not only answer questions like ChatGPT but also interpret images, analyze graphs, write code, and even perform step-by-step logical reasoning. Gemini is trained on a mixture of datasets and optimized to be useful across web search, education, coding, and vision-language tasks.
